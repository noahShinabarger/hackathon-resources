# Lab 1: Exploring APIs with Curl

Objective: Learn how to interact with APIs using the command-line tool `curl` by performing GET and POST requests.

## Overview

This lab presumes you are familiar with HTTP requests, particularly GET and
POST; if you'd like to read more about these methods, see this [brief
overview](./http-methods.md).
In this lab, we'll be using the JSONPlaceholder API, a simple, free-to-use REST API for testing and prototyping. You can find the API documentation at [https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com). This API provides several endpoints for interacting with fake data, such as users, posts, comments, and more.

## Step 1: Make a GET Request

We'll start by making a GET request to retrieve a list of users. To do this, run the following command:

```bash
curl -X GET https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users
```

This command sends a GET request to the API, which returns a JSON array containing user data. Each user has an ID, name, email, address, and other information.

## Step 2: Make a POST Request

Now, let's create a new post using a POST request. To do this, run the following command:

```bash
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"postId": 1, "name": "Jane Doe", "email": "jane.doe@example.com", "body": "This is a sample comment created using curl."}' https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/comments
```


This command sends a POST request to the API with the JSON data provided, creating a new comment. The `-d` flag is used to pass the JSON data with properties:

- `postId`: The ID of the post the comment is related to (e.g., 1).
- `name`: The name of the person who wrote the comment (e.g., "Jane Doe").
- `email`: The email address of the person who wrote the comment (e.g., "jane.doe@example.com").
- `body`: The content of the comment (e.g., "This is a sample comment created using curl.").

## Step 3: Interpret the Results from the POST Request

After executing the POST request, you'll receive a JSON response containing the newly created comment object. The JSON object includes the properties you've specified (`postId`, `name`, `email`, and `body`) as well as an autogenerated `id` property.

Example JSON response:

```json
{
  "postId": 1,
  "name": "Jane Doe",
  "email": "jane.doe@example.com",
  "body": "This is a sample comment created using curl.",
  "id": 501
}
```

## Conclusion

By the end of this lab, you should have a basic understanding of how to use `curl` to interact with APIs and perform GET and POST requests.

## Mayhem Heroes Workflow

1. Select a repository for integration.

    See the target requirements for more information on what qualifies for integration.

2. Create a fork of the repo you want to integrate. (If you are integrating an existing repo, please make sure you create a fork of the _mayhemheroes_ repo, NOT the upstream!)

3. Add additional harnessing or improve existing harnesses on the fork. You'll want to integrate your changes and ensure a successful action run _before_ submitting.

4. Submit [this form](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ).

5. Once ForAllSecure validates your target and elligiblity, you'll be asked to submit a pull request to the repository under github.com/mayhemheroes. If requested during the review, make changes.

6. Once your changes have been approved and merged, you'll be eligible for **up to $1000 for new integrations and $500 for existing integrations!**

## Target Checklist

Looking for a target to start working with? Start here!

### Submitting new repos

New repo submissions must meet the following requirements:

* Must not already exist under github.com/mayhemheroes

* Over 100 stars

* Active (has a commit from the past 6 months)

* Not a part of OSS-Fuzz (fuzzing integration already exists, that would be too easy! check here https://github.com/google/oss-fuzz/tree/master/projects)

* Nothing inappropriate - if youâ€™re not sure, just ask


### Improving existing repos

Existing repo submissions must meet the following requirements:

* Repos eligible for improvement _have_ already been forked under github.com/mayhemheroes

* You **must** add new harnessing or improve existing harnessing to these repositories

* Submissions will be graded on increased testsuite size, improved speed, added code coverage and defects found

If in doubt, ask in Discord or on the Mayhem Community.

_ForAllSecure reserves the right to reject any submission at its sole discretion._

## Troubleshooting Checklist

There are several small configuration steps that you'll need to take on your repo in order to properly integrate a repo with Mayhem. They are easy to miss, so here is a list for your reference:

* Package has public visibility.

* Repo has been linked and has read+write access to the package.

You can check the reply to [this community post](https://community.forallsecure.com/t/error-buildx-call-failed-with-error-denied-installation-not-allowed-to-write-organization-package/354/3) for more troubleshooting tips.
